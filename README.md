# SPEECH-ENHANCEMENT-USING-NLP
Natural language processing is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with computer-human language interaction.
The study of mathematical and computer modelling of many aspects of language, as well as the development of a wide range of systems, 
is known as natural language processing. The spoken language systems, which combine speech and natural language, are among them.
Because many elements of computer science deal with linguistic aspects of computation, natural language processing plays a role.
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of study and application that looks at how computers can interpret and modify natural language text or speech in order to 
perform useful tasks. The applications of Natural language processing includes fields of study, such as machine translation, natural language text processing and 
summarization, user interfaces, multilingual and cross language information retrieval (CLIR), speech recognition, artificial intelligence(AI) and expert systems.
We use this application in education field  improve the pronounciation ability  of the students using speech regonition and checking the similarity of the speech from
the orginal  content of the speech using NLP.
