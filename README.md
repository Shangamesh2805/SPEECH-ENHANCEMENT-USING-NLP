# SPEECH-ENHANCEMENT-USING-NLP

**NLP:**

Natural language processing is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with computer-human language interaction.The study of mathematical and computer modelling of many aspects of language, as well as the development of a wide range of systems, 
is known as natural language processing. The spoken language systems, which combine speech and natural language, are among them.
Because many elements of computer science deal with linguistic aspects of computation, natural language processing plays a role.
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of study and application that looks at how computers can interpret and modify natural language text or speech in order to 
perform useful tasks.

**FIELD OF USE:**

   The applications of Natural language processing includes fields of study, such as machine translation, natural language text processing and 
summarization, user interfaces, multilingual and cross language information retrieval (CLIR), speech recognition, artificial intelligence(AI) and expert systems.

**OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT:**

We used NLP in education field  to improve the vocabulary skills of the students. By identifying the mistakes of students in their pronounciation we help them to rectify their mistakes by themselves.

**Libraries Used:**
   •
    
**WORK FLOW:**

• Our project first gets the audio input and text input from the user/student.

• Then we process the audio file into into a standard .wav format to get accurate result.
